BufferInputStream doesn't attach with a file it attaches with any fileInputStream obj to monitor
if any late is happening in fetching the data.

it will first stores the data from the fileinputstream then for other parts it waits when the all parts 
are fetched then it will shows the value.

buffer stores the data for temporary.

it is used to run the program smoothly in which file input stream is present.

but if you are giving the data from the program to any other file i.e. output stream 
then buffer first will be attached with the data present in the program then it will attached with fileOutputSteam then this output stream will be
attached with the file to write the data.
